bindit

bindit is a script that mounts a filesystem and mount it via bindfs in another folder.
Then, it checks if the real mount is functional, if it is not, it kills the current binded mounts
and rebinds it.
This comes handy when a process is stuck while trying to access a non functional filesystem (eg: cifs,nfs)
that cannot be unmounted.
Since bindfs lives in userspace, the scripts can kill it and will free the stuck process.
Timeouts are configurable in the configuration file.

By defaults, configuration files live in /etc/bindfs/, an example is provided.

USAGE:
* Make a copy of example.cfg (name it, say, mymount.cfg), configure it and put it under/etc/bindfs
* Copy the provided systemd service file in /etc/systemd/system/
* issue systemctl daemon-reload with root privileges
* start/enable bindfsit@mymount.cfg
